<h1>Drip Irrigation, Me 3D Printed, and Restraints <h1>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1>The first project of this unit is to create an object that cannot be made subtractively. I have not done this
yet, but I want to make a cube inside of a cube. 
 <h1> 
 
 <h1>The next part of this unit is to scan youself and 3D print it. I was scanned by Mr. Gerber, and then I imported 
myself into Mesh Mixer. I then desiged my own pdistal, but could not get it to export, so I chose on off of 
Thingiverse. I then edidted my bust, and filled in holes. After I edited myself, using the transform tool, I used
the combine tool to attach myself to the base. I do not have mine printed yet, but I hope to upload pictures soon. 
For now, here are images of it:

 <h1> Lastly I made a drip irrigation. It is currently printing, so I will upload a picutre when it is done. This
 project was difficult for me becuase it was hard getting the right measurements, and then transferring them to 
 Fusion 360. I am hoping it fits the watter bottle. I first made a sketch of a right angle triangle. I then used 
 the revolve tool to create a cone. Then I made a circle on the base of the cone and extruded it. I used the second
 circle for a place to add threads. I then did a circle inside the smaller circle, to create a place for the water to
 sit, and then extruded a fourth, smaller circle, on the side of the cone, for the water to drip out of.
