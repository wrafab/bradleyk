<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1>For my first project I chose to design a stamp. I watched several videos to understand how to use Fusion 360. 
The process was not too diffucult to learn because I used SolidWorks last year. 
For the stamp, I did not use the video design, I wanted to make mine different. I started off by inserting a cylindar to create a round base.
Then I made a taller and thinner cylindar ontop. As a handle I used a sphere. It is a relatively simple design combining shapes.
To personalize my stamp I skeched my initials. Sketching my initias was the hardest part of the process. Making the letters look correct 
proved to be a challenge, but I got to experiment with different sketch tools; eclipse, spline, and trim.
