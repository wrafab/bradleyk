<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1>This time, we made skateboards. I designed mine, with different sized hexagons and pentagons, along with my initals. The desgin was 
easy, but tedious. I used the laser to engrave this design on my skateboard. The next step, was to assemble the board. We used a roller to 
apply glue to each layer. I then taped the board to a foam mold, placed the breather ontop, and put it in the vacuum seal bag. I sealed the
bag with tar, and then pumped all of the air out. I let it sit for a few days. I then took it out of the bag and sanded the edges down. 
I found this process to be fun, but frustrating, becuase I kept having to go back and forth between the two machines. I then coated my
board in epoxy, this is a sealant. While I was sanding, part of my B came off, becuase it was already pretty close to the edge of the board.
