<h1>Group Design Challenges: <h1> 
<br>
<br>
On the first day we were put into groups to compelete several different challenges. We were given a bag of 
supplies and we were only allowed to use what was in the bag, plus tape, to meet the requirements. One of the 
challenges was to try and make the longest ramp for a marble to roll down, but the marble had to land in a square.
We made a long ramp, but we did not support it in the best spots, so the marble ended up falling off of the ramp.
We tested the ramp before the "real" round, and the marble sucessfully went down the ramp, and lended in the square.
I helped create border of straws around the square to ensure the marble would stay inside of the box.

Our next challenge was to use raw spaghetti to support a marshmellow. The goal was to have the higest structure, without
it toppling over. Ours did not fall over, but it was not the highest. We had a tripod design, but we were not successful
in adding height to the design. This was a more difficult challenge and a little bit frustrating since my ideas were
kind of just shoved aside. I helped by ripping pieces of tape and holding sticks of raw pasta together.

Our final challenge was to build a structure out of plastic straws, string, and tape to support the weight of pennnies.
We made a swingset structure, which ended up concaving in. We should have made a triangular, tripod structure so the
weight could be evenly distributed. For this challenge I poked two holes in the sides of the cup and threaded the string 
through. I did not have a chance to contribute my thoughts to the design. I did participate with the design my group wanted
to do.
