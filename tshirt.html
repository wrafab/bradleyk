<h1>Rotation 2: T-Shirt <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> My second project in this class was to design somthing to print on a t-shirt. I used Corel Draw to make my design. 
There is no significance to designing a bike. I found this project fun and easy to do. This was my first time using 
the Brother GT-3 machine. I like that we can design a custom shirt and have the ability to print it right away. Some limitations 
for the Brother GT-3 would be the size of the object and the surface. If the design is too big, then it won't fit on the shirt, and
if the shrit is bumpy, then the print quality will be poor.

<h1> After designing and printing a t-shirt, I made a design for a phone case. I again, used my initials. At first
I used Corel Draw and then redeisnged it in Photoshop, so it would be easiter to send to the UV printer. I used the Roland 
program and the UV printer to print the design on the case. I did not get the laser in the right position, so half of the E 
is missing. I hope to reprint this case soon, becuase it is something I would use.
