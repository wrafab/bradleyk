<h1>Final Projectt <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1> It took a few days for me to think of a project that I wanted to create. I finally landed on a dog food dispenser.
First, I make a cardboard versioin, to test and see if this is something that would actually work. I am glad that I made
a test model, because it allowed me to make some changes to the design, in order for the food to acutally come out. 
I used maker case, so the sides would lock together. The walls are 12x7.5x7.5. And the funnel inside that holds the 
food is a trapezoid. The base lengths are 7.45 and 5. And it is 5 high. (All of these units are in inches). 
In one of the sides of my walls I have a 0.75 circle cut out, so I can put a dowel rod through it and a 5x2 rectangle 
cut out for the slide. The base of the dispenser is 8x8. I also created a 4.5x4.5 square so the jar can rest on it. 
I designed the structure of the dispenser on Corel Draw. The design took a class period to make. The following class,I
cut out the pieces and I started designing my slide. I additionally want to make a sticker that says my dogâ€™s name to 
put on the front. I ran into a lot of bumps during this project. It took longer than I thought it would. I had to 
carefully take measurments. I took a weekend to build my dispenser,and a class period to design the slide. Unfortunately 
the slide I desigend was too large to print, so it is not the correct size. If I want to use this at home, I will 
probably design one out of wood. It was difficult putting Charlie's name on the front, becuaseit would not release 
from the contact paper, and it doesn's stick to wood very well.It is hard to explain in words how this is assembled, so 
please look at the pictures below!
